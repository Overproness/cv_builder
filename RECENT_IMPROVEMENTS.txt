CV BUILDER IMPROVEMENTS - February 2026
========================================

The following 5 major improvements have been implemented:

1. ✅ ADD TO EXISTING CV FEATURE
   - New API endpoint: /api/resume/add
   - New function: addToExistingCV() in gemini.js
   - New UI mode in CV page: "Add to CV" button
   - Allows users to just describe new experience or projects
   - AI automatically parses and adds to the top of existing CV
   - Supports auto-detection or manual selection (experience/project)
   
   Usage Example:
   "Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft (Jan 2025 - Present)
   - Led team of 5 engineers building cloud infrastructure
   - Reduced deployment time by 40% using Kubernetes"
   
   The AI will parse this and add it as a new experience entry.

2. ✅ FIXED LATEX FORMATTING
   - Removed \vspace{-7pt} from projects section in latex.js
   - Projects now have proper spacing without negative vspace
   - Technologies line flows naturally without extra vertical spacing
   
   Before:
   \resumeProjectHeading
     {\textbf{Project}}{2024}
     \vspace{-7pt}  ← REMOVED
     \small{\emph{Python, ML}}
   
   After:
   \resumeProjectHeading
     {\textbf{Project}}{2024}
     \small{\emph{Python, ML}}

3. ✅ 1-PAGE RESUME ENFORCEMENT
   - Updated tailorCVForJob() in gemini.js
   - Target: 400-450 words (typical 1-page resume)
   - Limits to 2-3 experience entries with 2-3 bullets each
   - Limits to 2-3 project entries with 2-3 bullets each
   - Highly selective content - quality over quantity
   - AI prioritizes most impactful and relevant content

4. ✅ ATS KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION
   - AI extracts key technical skills from job description
   - Incorporates keywords naturally into bullet points
   - Adds relevant keywords to skills section
   - Maintains authenticity (no false claims)
   - Optimizes language to match job requirements
   
   Example: If job mentions "Kubernetes" and user has Docker experience,
   AI may add "container orchestration" or "Kubernetes" to skills if reasonable.

5. ✅ DEMO/LIVE LINKS SUPPORT
   - Added demo_link field to CV_SCHEMA in gemini.js
   - Updated projects section in latex.js to render links
   - Project names become hyperlinks if demo_link is provided
   - UI now has "Demo/Live Link" input field for projects
   - Links are preserved during CV tailoring
   
   In LaTeX output:
   \href{https://myproject.com}{\textbf{Project Name}}
   
   UI shows: 🌐 Demo/Live Link (Optional) input field
